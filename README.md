# ClassPeriods
The continuation of YUHSG Schedule.
This project was started to offer the scheduling capabilities of YUHSG Schedule to more schools. The original code wasn't kept under version control - this repo documents all of the changes I made after the initial release.
### Features:
- MySQL Database keeps track of different bell schedules (assemblies, etc.) and class schedules (rotating A/B/C)
- View the day's schedule and time remaining in the current period
- Log in to save your class schedule and view your classes in the live view
- Integrated admin panel allows new school days to be added without opening the database directly
